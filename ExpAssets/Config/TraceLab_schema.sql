******************************************************************************************
						NOTES ON HOW TO USE AND MODIFY THIS FILE
******************************************************************************************

This file is used at the beginning of your project to create the SQLite database in which
all recorded experiment data is stored.

By default there are only two tables that KLibs writes data to: the 'participants' table,
which stores demograpic and runtime information, and the 'trials' table, which is where
the data recorded at the end of each trial is logged. You can also create your own tables
in the database to record data for things that might happen more than once a trial
(e.g eye movements) or only once a session (e.g. a questionnaire or quiz), or to log data
for recycled trials that otherwise wouldn't get written to the 'trials' table.


As your project develops, you may change the number of columns, add other tables, or
change the names/datatypes of columns that already exist.

To do this, modify this document as needed, then rebuild the project database by running:

  klibs db-rebuild

while within the root of your project folder.

But be warned: THIS WILL DELETE ALL YOUR CURRENT DATA. The database will be completely 
destroyed and rebuilt. If you wish to keep the data you currently have, run:

  klibs export

while within the root of your project folder. This will export all participant and trial
data in the database to text files found in TraceLab/ExpAssets/Data.


Note that you *really* do not need to be concerned about datatypes when adding columns;
in the end, everything will be a string when the data is exported. The *only* reason you
would use a datatype other than 'text' would be to ensure that the program will throw an
error if, for example, it tries to assign a string to a column you know is always going
to be an integer.
