TraceLab is an experiment program designed to study motor control and learning — specifically, how complex motor skills are learned via physical practice or motor imagery.

The task requires participants to execute complex multi-joint upper limb movements by reproducing a series of shapes on a touchscreen. Learning in this task is defined by comparing participant performance on randomly generated shapes versus a repeating shape. The use of randomly generated movements throughout the experiment allows for some control over confounding factors that may influence changes in performance besides learning. The program also includes the ability to include a control task involving perceptual observation of shapes but with no movement task.

Instructions on how to install, run, and export data from TraceLab are provided below.

## Requirements

TraceLab is programmed in Python 2.7 (3.4+ compatible) using the [KLibs framework](https://github.com/a-hurst/klibs). It has been developed and tested on macOS (10.9 through 11.0), and has also been tested on recent versions of Linux (Mint 20.1 / Ubuntu 20.04) and Windows 10.

TraceLab was originally designed to run on a 24-inch touchscreen (specificaly, a [Planar PCT2485](https://www.amazon.com/Planar-PCT2485-Widescreen-Multi-Touch-Monitor/dp/B00DFB8KRQ)) at a resolution of 1920x1080. However, TraceLab should work on any touchscreen monitor provided that it has a high enough resolution (larger than 1024x768), and that the TraceLab analysis scripts have been modified to plot data properly at the screen's resolution.

## Getting Started

In order to install TraceLab and its prerequisites, there are two main options: a **global install** or a **pipenv install**. A global install will install klibs into your global Python environment, which can be simpler but may interfere with other Python scripts or packages installed on your system. A pipenv install will install klibs into a self-contained virtual environment using the [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) package, isolating it from all other Python scripts or packages on your target computer.

### Prerequisites

For either option, you will need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed in order for the commands to work. If you are using a Mac and already have Xcode or Homebrew installed, you already have Git. Additionally, on Linux you will need to manually install the SDL2, SDL2\_mixer, and SDL2\_ttf libraries for your distro using your distro's package manager.

Once Git has been installed, you can download TraceLab with the following commands (replacing `~/Downloads` with the path to the folder where you would like to install TraceLab):

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/LBRF/TraceLab.git
cd TraceLab
```

### Installing KLibs

#### Option 1: Global Installation

To install KLibs in your global Python environment, you can use **pip** Python package manager to install it by running the below command in a terminal window (replace `pip` with `pip3` if using Python 3):

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/a-hurst/klibs.git
```

#### Option 2: Pipenv Installation

To install KLibs in a self-contained virtual environment, navigate to the root of the TraceLab folder you downloaded, then install pipenv and use it to set up an environment for the project:

```bash
pip3 install pipenv
pipenv install
```

These commands should create a fresh environment for the TraceLab project with all its dependencies installed inside it. Note that to run commands using this environment, you will need to prefix them with `pipenv run`, e.g. `pipenv run klibs run 24`.

Note that this method currently requires Python 3.7 to be installed on your computer, though other versions may work if you modify the `python_version` field of the project's Pipfile.


### Running TraceLab

TraceLab is a KLibs experiment, meaning that it is run using the `klibs` command at the terminal (running the 'experiment.py' file using `python` directly will not work, and will print a warning).

To run the experiment, navigate to the TraceLab folder in Terminal and run `klibs run [screensize]`,
replacing `[screensize]` with the diagonal size of your display in inches (e.g. `klibs run 24` for a 24-inch monitor). If you just want to test the program out for yourself and skip demographics collection, you can add the `-d` flag to the end of the command to launch the experiment in development mode.


### Figure Generation

In TraceLab, some presented figures are randomly generated at the onset of the trial, whereas some figures are loaded from pre-generated **figure templates** and are identical in shape across trials. TraceLab comes with a set of pre-generated templates in the `ExpAssets/Resources/figures` directory, but you can generate your own templates using **capture figures mode**.

To enter capture figures mode, simply set the parameter `capture_figures_mode` to `True` in the experiment's parameters file (`ExpAssets/Config/TraceLab_params.py`) and launch TraceLab normally. You will be guided through the process of generating and saving your own template figures by the on-screen instructions.

To add template figures you have generated to your TraceLab study, just add the names of the desired template files (minus the ".zip" suffix) to either the "figure_name" factor in the experiment's `_independent_variables.py` file, or add them to a custom figure set defined in the `figure_sets.py` file.


## Exporting Data

The data recorded by TraceLab can be split into two groups: **figure & tracing data**, and **participant & trial data**. Various scripts for importing, joining, and analyzing both groups of data can be found in the [TraceLabR](https://github.com/LBRF/TraceLabR/) and [TraceLabAnalysis](https://github.com/LBRF/TraceLabAnalysis/) repositories.

### Figure and Tracing Data

Figure and tracing data is stored separately from other data in TraceLab. In the experiment's `ExpAssets/Data/` folder, each participant has a separate folder containing their figure data, identified by participant id and the date/time the id was initialized (e.g. `p9_2019-11-11_19-54`).

Each participant tracing folder contains a separate folder for each session of the task (e.g. `session_1/`, `session_2/`), with each session folder containing `.zip` files with the figure data from each trial of that session.

```
Each trial's `.zip` file contains data files with the following suffixes:

File | Description
--- | ---
`preview.png` | An image of the fully-interpolated figure shown on the trial
`.tlf` | A text file containing the (x, y) pixel coordinates and timestamps for each frame of the figure animated on the trial.
`.tlfp` | A text file containing the (x, y) pixel coordinates of the vertices of the figure animated on the trial.
`.tlfs` | A text file containing the (x, y) pixel coordinates of the start/end/control points for each segment of the figure animated on the trial.
`.tlt` | A text file containing the (x, y) pixel coordinates and timestamps for each sample of a recorded tracing response (physical trials only).

Additionally, the file name for each trial's `.zip` contains the (p)articipant id number, (s)ession number, (b)lock number, (t)rial number and date for the trial. For example, `p1_s2_b1_t3_2018-11-30.zip` would contain the data for block 1, trial 3 of session 2 (recorded on November 30, 2018) for the participant whose database ID is 1.

### Participant & Trial Data

Apart from figures and figure tracings, all data collected in TraceLab is neatly organized in an SQL database. To export this data from TraceLab, simply run

```
klibs export
```

while in the TraceLab directory. This will export the trial data from all participants into individual tab-delimited text files for each participant in the project's `ExpAssets/Data` subfolder.

Data from any participants that did not complete all of their sessions will be saved to the `ExpAssets/Data/incomplete` folder.
